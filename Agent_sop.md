# 🚀 AGENT_SOP.md — Standard Operating Protocol for AI Agents
### Applies to: Antigravity IDE · Gemini CLI · Claude Code · Cursor · Codex CLI · OpenCode · AdaL CLI
### Version: 3.0.0 — FINAL | Maintainer: RapidXAI | February 2026
### Source Skills: Antigravity Awesome Skills (868+ skills) — github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills


---


> ⚠️ **ABSOLUTE MANDATE:** Every AI agent — regardless of tool, model, or task — MUST read and execute this SOP in full before writing a single line of code, generating a single component, or making any architectural decision. This document IS the operating system of every project. No exceptions. No shortcuts.


---


## 🧠 CORE PHILOSOPHY: THE TANDEM SKILL DOCTRINE


> Read this before everything else. This is the single most important concept in this document.


**A single skill is a single expert. Every real project needs a full team.**


You are NOT limited to invoking one skill at a time. Invoking a single skill for most tasks is negligence. You MUST evaluate every task, identify every discipline it touches, and invoke ALL relevant skills simultaneously or in a defined sequence.


### The Three Laws of Skill Invocation


**Law 1 — Never use one skill where two or more apply.**
If a task touches design AND code, invoke both `@ui-ux-pro-max` AND `@react-patterns`. If it touches code AND security, invoke both `@typescript-expert` AND `@api-security-best-practices`. Always.


**Law 2 — Skills within the same layer run in parallel. Skills across layers run in sequence.**
You can invoke `@frontend-design` + `@react-patterns` + `@tailwind-patterns` at the same time because they are all frontend skills operating on the same surface. But you run planning BEFORE building, and testing AFTER building.


**Law 3 — Declare your full skill stack before you touch anything.**
At the start of every session and every major task, output a skill stack declaration (see Phase 0). An undeclared skill is an unused skill.


### The Tandem Mental Model


Think of every project as a building with floors. Each floor needs its own specialist team, and no floor can be skipped:


```
PROJECT STACK — ALL FLOORS MUST BE STAFFED
├── Floor 6: Business     → @brainstorming + @concise-planning + @copywriting
├── Floor 5: Design       → @ui-ux-pro-max + @frontend-design + @tailwind-patterns
├── Floor 4: Frontend     → @react-best-practices + @react-patterns + @nextjs-best-practices
├── Floor 3: Backend      → @senior-fullstack + @backend-dev-guidelines + @api-patterns
├── Floor 2: Data         → @database-design + @postgres-best-practices + @sql-pro
├── Floor 1: Security     → @api-security-best-practices + @backend-security-coder + @frontend-security-coder
└── Floor 0: Infra        → @docker-expert + @deployment-procedures + @observability-engineer
```


You do not need every floor for every task. But you MUST identify which floors are touched and staff them all.


### Tandem Invocation — Real Syntax Examples


Invoke multiple skills in a single prompt, explicitly:


```
"Use @ui-ux-pro-max and @react-patterns together to build the hero section.
Also apply @tailwind-patterns for all styling and @seo-audit for meta structure."
```


```
"Invoke @senior-fullstack alongside @backend-dev-guidelines and @api-patterns
to design and implement the authentication module, with @api-security-best-practices
and @auth-implementation-patterns running in parallel for every decision."
```


```
"Run @test-driven-development, @e2e-testing-patterns, and @browser-automation
in tandem to produce unit, integration, and E2E tests for the checkout flow."
```


```
"Use @brainstorming and @concise-planning together to plan the sprint,
then use @product-manager-toolkit to produce the PRD."
```

## PHASE 0 — PRE-BOOT & SKILL STACK DECLARATION {#phase-0}


> **Trigger:** ALWAYS. The very first thing in every session, before any other action.


### 0.1 — Read the Brain Directory First


```bash
cat .gemini/antigravity/brain/architecture.md 2>/dev/null
cat .gemini/antigravity/brain/decisions.md 2>/dev/null
cat .gemini/antigravity/brain/stack.md 2>/dev/null
cat .gemini/antigravity/brain/skill-tandems.md 2>/dev/null
cat .gemini/antigravity/brain/conventions.md 2>/dev/null
```


If brain files exist → load ALL prior decisions and do not contradict them unless explicitly told to.


### 0.2 — Verify Skill Installation


```bash
# Check universal path first
test -d ~/.agent/skills && echo "✅ Skills ready at ~/.agent/skills"


# If not found, install immediately:
npx antigravity-awesome-skills


# Tool-specific fallbacks:
# npx antigravity-awesome-skills --claude   → .claude/skills/
# npx antigravity-awesome-skills --gemini   → .gemini/skills/
# npx antigravity-awesome-skills --cursor   → .cursor/skills/
# npx antigravity-awesome-skills --codex    → .codex/skills/


# If 404 error:
# npx github:sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills
```


### 0.3 — Mandatory Skill Stack Declaration


Output this block BEFORE any work begins. It is non-negotiable:


```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```


### 0.4 — Establish Operating Context


Before writing anything, answer these internally:


```
- What is the business goal? (Not just the technical ask)
- Which floors of the project stack does this session touch?
- What constraints exist? (Budget, timeline, API limits, hosting)
- Who is the end user? (B2B / B2C / Developer / Non-technical)
- What integrations are required?
```


---


## PHASE 1 — PROJECT DISCOVERY & INTELLIGENCE GATHERING {#phase-1}


> **Trigger:** New project, new major feature, or first session on an unfamiliar codebase.


### 1.1 — Codebase Scan


```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" \) | head -80
cat package.json 2>/dev/null
cat requirements.txt 2>/dev/null
cat .env.example 2>/dev/null
ls -la
```


### 1.2 — Planning Tandem (Always These Three Together)


```
Use @brainstorming and @concise-planning together to analyze the project goal
and produce a prioritized, structured development plan.
Simultaneously use @product-manager-toolkit to define acceptance criteria
and RICE-score the feature priorities.
```


These three always run together. `@brainstorming` generates ideas → `@concise-planning` structures them → `@product-manager-toolkit` turns them into a shippable spec.


### 1.3 — Business Context Alignment


Resolve all of these before writing a single line of code:


- What is the core user journey from landing to conversion?
- What does "done" look like for this milestone?
- What are the hard constraints? (deadline, spend cap, team size)
- What existing systems must this connect to?


### 1.4 — Preliminary Risk Scan (Dual-Skill)


```
Use @vulnerability-scanner and @api-security-best-practices together
to perform a preliminary dual-layer risk scan on the project type
and any third-party integrations involved.
```


---


## PHASE 2 — ARCHITECTURE & SYSTEM DESIGN {#phase-2}


> **Trigger:** New project, major refactor, or any feature touching more than 3 files.


### 2.1 — Architecture Triple Invocation


```
Use @senior-architect, @architecture-patterns, and @architecture-decision-records together:
- @senior-architect: owns high-level system design, scaling strategy, component boundaries
- @architecture-patterns: selects the right pattern (Clean Architecture, DDD, Hexagonal, Microservices)
- @architecture-decision-records: produces a formal, dated ADR for every major decision
All three run in tandem — the architect's decisions feed directly into the pattern selection,
which feeds directly into the ADR document.
```


### 2.2 — Stack Selection Criteria (Non-Negotiable)


| Criterion | Minimum Standard |
|---|---|
| Scalability | Handles 10x current load without architecture change |
| Maintainability | Any developer understands the codebase in <30 min |
| Cost | Monthly infra cost documented before first commit |
| Security | Auth, RBAC, and data isolation designed at layer 0 |
| Developer Experience | Hot reload, strict typing, linting active from day 1 |


### 2.3 — API Contract Design (Tandem)


```
Use @senior-fullstack, @api-patterns, and @typescript-expert together.
@api-patterns selects the API style (REST vs GraphQL vs tRPC).
@senior-fullstack designs the contract shape and data flow.
@typescript-expert defines strict TypeScript types and interfaces.
If Python: swap @typescript-expert for @python-patterns or @fastapi-pro.
```


### 2.4 — Database Schema Design


```
Use @database-design and @postgres-best-practices together for all schema work.
@database-design: normalization, relationships, ORM selection, indexing strategy.
@postgres-best-practices: Postgres-specific optimization, query patterns, RLS policies.
For Supabase projects: also invoke @supabase (if available) for native Supabase patterns.
```


### 2.5 — Write Architecture to Brain


After this phase, IMMEDIATELY write all decisions:


```bash
mkdir -p .gemini/antigravity/brain/
# Write: architecture summary, stack decisions, ADRs, API contracts to brain files
```


---


## PHASE 3 — WEB DESIGN & UI/UX EXECUTION {#phase-3}


> **Trigger:** Any frontend work — landing pages, dashboards, SaaS UIs, client websites.


### 3.1 — The Designer + Developer Core Duo (MANDATORY PAIRING)


> This is the most fundamental tandem in all frontend work. These two skills are NEVER separated.


```
Use @ui-ux-pro-max and @react-patterns together for ALL frontend work.
This pairing is non-negotiable. One without the other produces incomplete output.


@ui-ux-pro-max owns:
 - Design system (tokens: color, spacing, typography, radius, shadow)
 - Visual hierarchy and layout rhythm
 - Component visual states (default, hover, active, disabled, error)
 - Mobile-first responsive breakpoints
 - Accessibility (contrast ratios, ARIA, focus management)


@react-patterns owns:
 - Component architecture and file structure
 - Hook design and state management
 - Performance (memoization, lazy loading, code splitting)
 - Composability and reusability patterns
```


### 3.2 — Extended Frontend Stack for Full Pages


For any complete page (not just a component), extend the core duo into a full stack:


```
Use @ui-ux-pro-max + @frontend-design + @react-patterns + @react-best-practices
   + @tailwind-patterns + @nextjs-best-practices together.


Role breakdown:
- @ui-ux-pro-max:          Design system, tokens, visual language
- @frontend-design:        Aesthetics, layout composition, colour usage
- @react-patterns:         Component structure and React best practices
- @react-best-practices:   Performance optimization and React 19+ patterns
- @tailwind-patterns:      Utility-first CSS with Tailwind v4
- @nextjs-best-practices:  App Router, RSC, Server Actions, route handlers
```


### 3.3 — Conversion & Marketing Pages (Full 6-Skill Stack)


Landing pages, pricing pages, and any conversion-critical surface require all six:


```
Use @ui-ux-pro-max + @frontend-design + @react-patterns + @tailwind-patterns
   + @copywriting + @seo-audit + @form-cro together.


- @copywriting:  All user-facing text — headlines, CTAs, microcopy, value props
- @seo-audit:    Meta structure, semantic HTML, structured data, page titles
- @form-cro:     Form design optimized for conversion and reduced friction
```


### 3.4 — Immersive / Animated Design


For scroll experiences, 3D elements, or interactive portfolios:


```
Use @ui-ux-pro-max + @scroll-experience + @3d-web-experience + @react-patterns together.
- @scroll-experience:    Scroll-driven animations and parallax patterns
- @3d-web-experience:    Three.js and React Three Fiber integration
```


### 3.5 — Mobile Design


```
Use @ui-ux-pro-max + @mobile-design + @react-patterns together for all mobile-first work.
@mobile-design: Touch targets, gesture handling, viewport scaling, iOS/Android quirks.
```


### 3.6 — Design Tokens (Mandatory Before Any Styled Component)


Before writing a single styled component, establish:


```typescript
// tokens.ts — define FIRST, use everywhere
const tokens = {
 colors: { primary, secondary, accent, surface, error, success },
 spacing: { xs: 4, sm: 8, md: 16, lg: 24, xl: 32, xxl: 48 },
 typography: { fontFamily, fontSizes, fontWeights, lineHeights },
 radii: { sm: 4, md: 8, lg: 16, full: 9999 },
 shadows: { sm, md, lg, xl }
}
```


### 3.7 — Accessibility Standards (Non-Negotiable)


Every interactive element MUST have:
- `aria-label` or visible label text
- Keyboard navigability (`tabIndex`, `focus-visible` styles)
- Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (WCAG AA minimum)
- Screen reader compatible semantic markup


### 3.8 — Responsive Breakpoints (Test All Before Marking Done)


- `sm` 640px — mobile
- `md` 768px — tablet
- `lg` 1024px — laptop
- `xl` 1280px — desktop
- `2xl` 1536px — wide monitor


---


## PHASE 4 — SENIOR CODE DEVELOPMENT {#phase-4}


> **Trigger:** Anytime code is being written — features, fixes, refactors, automation, scripts.


### 4.1 — Pre-Code Mandatory Checklist


Before writing ANY code, confirm all are true:


- [ ] Architecture decisions are clear and in brain files
- [ ] Types/interfaces are defined before implementation (TypeScript) or type hints written (Python)
- [ ] The function/component has a single, clear responsibility
- [ ] Edge cases are identified and will be handled explicitly
- [ ] The active skill stack covers every discipline this code touches
- [ ] The code can be tested in isolation


### 4.2 — Full-Stack Feature Development — The 7-Layer Stack


When building a complete feature end-to-end, all seven layers must be staffed:


```
Layer 1 — Planning:
 Use @brainstorming + @concise-planning to spec the feature before touching code.


Layer 2 — Design:
 Use @ui-ux-pro-max + @frontend-design + @react-patterns for all UI surfaces.


Layer 3 — Frontend:
 Use @react-best-practices + @tailwind-patterns + @nextjs-best-practices.


Layer 4 — Backend:
 Use @senior-fullstack + @backend-dev-guidelines + @api-patterns.


Layer 5 — Data:
 Use @database-design + @postgres-best-practices.


Layer 6 — Security:
 Use @api-security-best-practices + @backend-security-coder + @frontend-security-coder.
 (Security is ALWAYS active — it does not get deactivated for "quick" features.)


Layer 7 — Testing:
 Use @test-driven-development + @e2e-testing-patterns.
```


### 4.3 — Language & Framework Tandems


**TypeScript / React / Next.js:**
```
Use @typescript-expert + @react-best-practices + @react-patterns
   + @nextjs-best-practices + @nextjs-app-router-patterns together.
```


**Python / FastAPI:**
```
Use @python-pro + @python-patterns + @fastapi-pro
   + @async-python-patterns + @python-testing-patterns together.
```


**Node.js API:**
```
Use @senior-fullstack + @backend-dev-guidelines + @typescript-expert
   + @nodejs-best-practices + @api-security-best-practices together.
```


**AI Agent / LLM System:**
```
Use @ai-agents-architect + @prompt-engineering + @rag-engineer
   + @langgraph + @llm-app-patterns + @context-window-management together.
All six are required for any non-trivial AI system.
```


**N8N / Make / Automation Workflow:**
```
Use @workflow-automation (if available) + @api-patterns
   + @api-security-best-practices + @systematic-debugging together.
```


**Game Development (Unity/Unreal):**
```
Use @unity-developer + @game-design + @3d-games together for 3D.
Use @unity-developer + @game-design + @2d-games together for 2D.
Also invoke @algorithmic-art for procedural asset generation.
```


### 4.4 — Code Quality Standards (Hard Rules)


| Standard | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Function length | Maximum 40 lines per function |
| Cyclomatic complexity | Maximum 10 |
| Naming | Self-documenting — no single-letter variables except loop iterators |
| Comments | Only explain "why", never "what" — the code explains what |
| Error handling | Every async function has try/catch or an error boundary |
| Logging | Structured logs with context — no raw `console.log` in production |
| Secrets | ALL keys in `.env` — never hardcoded, never committed, never logged |


### 4.5 — API Integration Standards


```
Use @api-security-best-practices + @auth-implementation-patterns together
for every external API integration.
```


- API keys: `.env` always — if it's hardcoded, it's wrong
- Webhook payloads: validate signature before processing
- External calls: retry with exponential backoff
- Rate limits: respect provider limits, implement client-side throttling


### 4.6 — Stripe / Payments


```
Use @stripe-integration + @api-security-best-practices + @pci-compliance together.
No payment integration is complete without all three.
```


### 4.7 — Communications (Twilio, SMS, Voice)


```
Use @twilio-communications + @api-security-best-practices together.
```


---


## PHASE 5 — SENIOR CODE ANALYSIS & REVIEW {#phase-5}


> **Trigger:** Code review, PR review, debugging session, refactoring, or taking over an existing codebase.


### 5.1 — Full Code Audit — Mandatory 5-Skill Tandem


```
Use @senior-architect + @lint-and-validate + @vulnerability-scanner
   + @code-review-checklist + @systematic-debugging together.


Each skill produces its own report. Reports are then merged:
- @senior-architect:        Architectural quality, technical debt, scaling risks
- @lint-and-validate:       Static analysis, code style, type errors
- @vulnerability-scanner:   OWASP Top 10, dependency CVEs, injection risks
- @code-review-checklist:   PR-level checklist, logic errors, missed edge cases
- @systematic-debugging:    Root cause analysis for any identified failures
```


### 5.2 — Performance Analysis


```
Use @performance-engineer + @react-best-practices together to identify:
```


- N+1 database queries
- Blocking main thread operations
- Unnecessary re-renders (React DevTools Profiler)
- Unoptimized bundle size (`next build && next analyze`)
- Missing image optimization


**Lighthouse targets:** ≥ 90 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO


### 5.3 — Technical Debt Classification


Label all findings before handing off:


| Label | Definition | Required Action |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Security vulnerability or data loss risk | Block merge — fix first |
| 🟠 HIGH | Broken user flow or major performance issue | Fix in current sprint |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Code smell, missing test, or anti-pattern | Fix in next sprint |
| 🟢 LOW | Style inconsistency or minor refactor opportunity | Backlog |


### 5.4 — Dependency Audit


```bash
npm audit --audit-level=high
# Python:
pip-audit
```


`high` or `critical` severity = **merge blocked until resolved**.


---


## PHASE 6 — SECURITY HARDENING {#phase-6}


> **Trigger:** Before ANY production deployment. After any auth change. Weekly on all live products.


### 6.1 — The Security Trio (Always All Three, Never Fewer)


```
Use @api-security-best-practices + @backend-security-coder + @frontend-security-coder together.
These three are NEVER invoked individually for production security work.
They always run as a trio — API layer, server layer, and client layer simultaneously.


For deep audits, extend to the full Security Engineer stack:
Use @ethical-hacking-methodology + @top-web-vulnerabilities + @security-auditor
   + @vulnerability-scanner + @api-security-best-practices together.
```


### 6.2 — Authentication & Authorization Rules


```
Use @auth-implementation-patterns for all auth implementation.
```


- Auth is NEVER built from scratch — use Supabase Auth, NextAuth, Clerk, or Auth0
- Every route has explicit RBAC defined before any code is written
- JWT tokens: 15-minute access, 7-day refresh, never localStorage
- All sensitive operations require explicit re-authentication


### 6.3 — Data Protection


- PII is never logged, anywhere, ever
- PII fields are encrypted at rest
- All transmission uses HTTPS (TLS 1.3 minimum)
- File uploads: validate type AND magic bytes (not just file extension)
- ALL SQL queries: parameterized statements only — no string interpolation


### 6.4 — Mandatory Security Headers


```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```


### 6.5 — Payments Security


```
Use @pci-compliance + @stripe-integration + @api-security-best-practices together.
Never handle raw card data — always use Stripe Elements or Stripe Checkout.
```


---


## PHASE 7 — INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT {#phase-7}


> **Trigger:** Before any deployment — staging or production.


### 7.1 — Deployment Tandem


```
Use @deployment-procedures + @docker-expert + @observability-engineer together
for all deployments.
- @deployment-procedures: safe rollout strategy, canary/blue-green, rollback plan
- @docker-expert:         container build optimization, multi-stage Dockerfiles, compose
- @observability-engineer: monitoring setup, alerting thresholds, health checks
For AWS: add @aws-serverless as a fourth skill.
For K8s: add @kubernetes-architect as a fourth skill.
For IaC: add @terraform-specialist as a fifth skill.
```


### 7.2 — Environment Management


Every project runs three environments with no exceptions:


| Environment | Purpose | Auto-Deploy | Approval Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `development` | Local dev, experiments | No | No |
| `staging` | Pre-prod testing, client demos | Yes (on PR) | No |
| `production` | Live user traffic | No | Yes — manual only |


### 7.3 — Pre-Deployment Checklist


- [ ] All environment variables set in deployment platform (NOT in `.env` file committed to git)
- [ ] Database migrations are backwards-compatible (can roll back without data loss)
- [ ] Health check endpoint active and returns 200 (`/api/health`)
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry or equivalent)
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented AND tested
- [ ] Rate limiting active on all public-facing endpoints
- [ ] Security headers verified


### 7.4 — CI/CD Pipeline — Required Order


1. `lint` — fail fast on style and formatting
2. `type-check` — TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` or mypy
3. `test` — unit + integration
4. `build` — production build must succeed
5. `security-scan` — `npm audit --audit-level=high`
6. `deploy` — only on `main` or tagged release branch, after human approval for production


---


## PHASE 8 — TESTING & QA {#phase-8}


> **Trigger:** After every feature. Before every PR. Before every deployment.


### 8.1 — The QA Skill Stack (All Five Active Together)


```
Use @test-driven-development + @systematic-debugging + @browser-automation
   + @e2e-testing-patterns + @test-fixing together.


Role breakdown:
- @test-driven-development:  Red/green/refactor cycle — write tests first
- @systematic-debugging:     Root cause analysis when tests fail
- @browser-automation:       Playwright-based E2E and browser automation
- @e2e-testing-patterns:     Reliable, non-flaky E2E test suite design
- @test-fixing:              Systematic approach to fixing broken tests after refactors
```


### 8.2 — Test Coverage Requirements


| Layer | Minimum Coverage | Test Type |
|---|---|---|
| Pure utility functions | 100% | Unit |
| API routes / handlers | 90% | Integration |
| Critical UI components | 80% | Component |
| Critical user journeys | 100% | E2E |


### 8.3 — Non-Negotiable E2E Tests (Must Exist Before Production)


- User registration and email verification
- Login, logout, session expiry
- Core conversion action (signup CTA, purchase, booking, form submission)
- Payment flow (if applicable — full Stripe test mode run)
- Data submission and retrieval round-trip
- Error states (network failure, validation errors, 404, 500)
- Empty states (new user, no data, no results)


### 8.4 — Performance Benchmarks


```bash
npx lhci autorun
# Load test:
npx autocannon -c 100 -d 30 https://staging.yourapp.com/api/health
```


---


## PHASE 9 — DOCUMENTATION & HANDOFF {#phase-9}


> **Trigger:** After every major feature. At project completion. Before any handoff.


### 9.1 — Documentation Tandem


```
Use @documentation-templates + @changelog-automation together.
@documentation-templates: standardized docs structure and handoff format.
@changelog-automation: keep release notes consistent and up to date automatically.
```


### 9.2 — Mandatory Documentation Set


| Document | Location | Owner Skill | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Root | `@documentation-templates` | Setup, run, deploy, env vars |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | `/docs` | `@architecture-decision-records` | System design, ADRs, data flow |

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS {#emergency}


### Production Is Down


```
1. DO NOT make changes without a documented rollback plan.
2. Use @observability-engineer + @systematic-debugging + @incident-responder together
  to diagnose the failure and coordinate response.
3. Check logs FIRST — never guess the cause.
4. Roll back to last known good deployment.
5. Use @postmortem-writing to write a blameless post-mortem within 24 hours.
```


### Security Breach Suspected


```
1. IMMEDIATELY revoke all active API keys, sessions, and tokens.
2. Use @vulnerability-scanner + @api-security-best-practices
  + @ethical-hacking-methodology together to assess the full attack surface.
3. Do not discuss the breach publicly until investigation is complete.
4. Notify affected users within 72 hours (GDPR/compliance requirement).
5. Use @security-auditor to document findings and remediation.
```


### Runaway API Costs (Google AI Studio / Gemini)


```
1. Immediately add hard spend cap in Google Cloud Console.
2. Use @api-security-best-practices + @observability-engineer together
  to identify the source of runaway calls and add rate limiting.
3. Enable billing alerts at 50%, 80%, and 100% of budget threshold.
4. Review all public endpoints for missing authentication.
```


### Critical Bug in Production


```
Use @systematic-debugging + @incident-responder together for active debugging.
Use @test-driven-development to write a regression test before deploying the fix.
Never deploy a fix without a test that catches it.
```

## 🧠 PROJECT BRAIN MANAGEMENT {#brain}


### Brain Directory Structure


```
.gemini/antigravity/brain/
├── architecture.md       # System design decisions and ADRs
├── stack.md              # Tech stack with justifications and alternatives rejected
├── decisions.md          # Key decisions with rationale, date, and owner
├── conventions.md        # Naming, folder structure, code conventions
├── integrations.md       # All external APIs, key structure, webhook endpoints
├── known-issues.md       # Known bugs, technical debt, workarounds
├── skill-tandems.md      # ⭐ Successful skill combos discovered in this project
└── session-log.md        # Summary of what was accomplished each session
```


> `skill-tandems.md` is critical. Every time a skill combination works exceptionally well for this specific project, log it here so every future agent session can build on it without rediscovering it.


### Brain Read Protocol (Every Session Start)


```bash
# Run this before anything else in every session
for f in architecture stack decisions conventions integrations skill-tandems; do
 echo "=== $f ===" && cat ".gemini/antigravity/brain/$f.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "(not yet written)"
done
```


### Brain Write Protocol (Every Session End and After Major Decisions)


Write to brain after:
- Every architectural decision (with rationale and date)
- Every new convention established
- Every new external integration added
- Every successful new skill tandem discovered
- Every significant bug found AND its root cause
- Every session end (what was accomplished, what is next)


---


## ✅ SESSION COMPLETION CHECKLIST {#checklist}


Before ending ANY work session, every item must be checked:


**Code Quality**
- [ ] Lint and type checks pass (`npm run lint && tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] No secrets or API keys anywhere in committed code
- [ ] All new code has corresponding tests
- [ ] No `console.log` statements in production paths


**Documentation**
- [ ] Brain files updated with session summary and any new decisions
- [ ] `brain/skill-tandems.md` updated with effective skill combinations used today
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with what changed
- [ ] Outstanding TODOs have GitHub issue numbers assigned


**Deployment (if applicable)**
- [ ] Staging deployment verified and tested
- [ ] Security headers confirmed active
- [ ] Monitoring alerts confirmed active
- [ ] Rollback procedure confirmed available


**Handoff**
- [ ] Next session's starting point is documented in `brain/session-log.md`
- [ ] Any blockers or open questions are written down explicitly
